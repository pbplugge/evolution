### A C++ Evolutionary programs / algorithms library for python.

For my own project i could not find a library that does what i need it to do.
A python library would be too slow. But i want to use python for my analysis.
There are more reasons like evolving parameters inside nodes/components that influence the nodes/components.
So i decided to write my own library.

My design goal is an easy to use general purpose evolution library.
You will need to be able to code some C++ but i made it very simple.
With easy to follow examples and python notebooks 

My goal is to add to this project frequently. Hopefully some of you will join me in developing this.

# This is just a first commit to get started. I will add & update new stuff soon.

### How does it work?

Clone the repository.
Go to the directory and execute build.sh
It should compile without errors or warnings.
Put the created _evolution.so in the notebooks directory.
Start python notebook in the notebooks directory.

You can also use C++ instead of python.

Either way you will need to create some C++ code simmilar to the code of the examples.

I will go in to more detail later.
